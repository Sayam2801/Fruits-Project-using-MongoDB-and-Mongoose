Remember to install mongodb and mongoose packages from NPM in order to develop this project.
Commands are as follows:

npm install mongodb
npm install mongoose

For further development of this project, you can refer to the documentation of both MongoDB as well as Mongoose, although to be honest, I would suggest you to use Mongoose to deploy backend servers.
